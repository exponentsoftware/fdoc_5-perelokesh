a)   What is the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce.Explain these using your own words ?

* forEach:- The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.

* map:- Array.map() method creates a new array from the results of calling a function for every element

* filter:- The filter() method will create an array filled with all array elements that pass a test.

* reduce:- The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array.

b)  Explain the difference between function declaration and arrow function ?

* function declaration:- It will tell compiler about the function name , its return type, and parameters
                         its a function statement which has parameters.
                         its defined using function keyword.
                         they will execute when they are called.
    syntax--    function functionName(parameters) {
                    // code to be executed
                }

c) Explain the difference between find and findIndex ?

* find():- Will return a value of array element that passes a test function
           if function returns true value , than find() will return value of that element.
           otherwise it returns undefined

* findIndex:- Will return index of first array element that passes a test function.
              otherwise it returns -1

d) If you like to filter out one object element in an array which method do you like to use: filter or find ? Explain

* filter:- as it creates an array filled with all array elements.
           also its supported  by browsers.


e) Explain the difference of var, let and const when we declare a variable ?

  * var :- var is global scope & function scope 
           its global when its declared outside a function .. which means its available in use to the whole window.
           its function when its declared inside  a function (within).. which mean it can be access only inside function

  * let & const are block scope

    for let :- if variable is declared with let .. we can used only inside that block.
               it cant be re-declared bt can be updated
               if its not initialized will get reference error

    for const :- it can only be accessed when they are declared in a block.
                 it cant be updated or re-declared.
                 its imp to initialized when its declared.
